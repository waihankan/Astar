README FILE IS JUST AN INSTRUCTION ON THE CODE.


>>> THE CODE IS WRITTEN IN .m files WHICH IS MATLAB FILE EXTENTION FORMAT.
    IN CASE YOU DON'T HAVE A MATLAB SOFTWARE IN YOUR COMPUTER, YOU CAN OPEN WITH MOST OF THE TEXT EDITOR. I RECOMMEND USING THE NOTEPAD WHICH IS PREINSTALLED IN WINDOWS 7,8,10.
    THE .git FILES AND .gitignore IS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE REVIEWER.


Please follow the guide to use the program.

> Add the file path of all the associated function files to the current folder.
> For importing the files, (nodes.csv, edges.csv) just enter the parameters in the according function.
> For other files, you can modify the importnodes.m and importedges.m files to your favor.

THANK YOU, my assignment reviewer! GOOD LUCK!
